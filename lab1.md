# cd command

When cd was used with no arguments, we stayed in the same directory which is not an error as using cd without any arguments takes us to home directory.

When cd is used with a directory as an arguement, it takes us inside that directory

When cd is used with file as an arguement, it says 'not a directory'. This is not an error as cd is can only be used to change directory into another directory or a file. 

# ls command

When ls is used without any arguements it gives a list of whats inside our current directory which would be /home.

When ls is used with a path to a directory as an argument it will list the items within that directory.

When ls is used with a path to a file as an argument it doesn't list the contents of the text file instead it gives us the path to the text file.

# cat command
![Image](catempty.png)  
When cat does not take any argument it does not do any but let us type stuff. This is not an error as when cat does not take in any arguments it waits for an input to be typed. To exit this, one can press ctrl +  c.
![Image](catdirectory.png)  
When the cat command takes a path to a directory as an argument it simply tells us that it is directory.

When the cat command takes a path to a file as an argument it displays the contents of the file. This is not an error but instead a feature of cat.
