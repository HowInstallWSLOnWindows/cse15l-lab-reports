# cd command

When cd was used with no arguments, we stayed in the same directory which is not an error as using cd without any arguments takes us to home directory but since we were already in home directory nothing changed.

When cd is used with a directory as an arguement, it takes us inside that directory. We know we are inside a different directory as there is now /lecture1 after the '~' symbol.

When cd is used with file as an arguement, it says 'not a directory'. This is not an error as cd is can only be used to change from one directory into another and not into a file.

# ls command

When ls is used without any arguements it gives a list the files of the directory we are in. Since we in the /home directory it will list 'lecture1' since that is file within the /home directory.

When ls is used with a path to a directory as an argument it will list the items within that directory. Since argument directory is /lecture1 it lists the files: Hello.java, Hello.class, messages, and README.

When ls is used with a path to a file as an argument it doesn't list the contents of the text file instead it gives us the path to the text file.

# cat command
![Image](catempty.png)  
When cat does not take any argument it does not do anything but let the user type stuff. This is not an error as when cat does not take in any arguments it waits for an input to be typed. To exit this press ctrl +  c.

When the cat command takes a path to a directory as an argument it tells us that it is directory. This is not an error as cat is used to print the contents of one or more files given by the paths.

When the cat command takes a path to a file as an argument it displays the contents of the file.
